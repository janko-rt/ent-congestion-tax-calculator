Questions/observations
Should tax amounts which would go over 60 SEK be subject to change to accommodate the 60SEK limit or outright fully discarded
Is this application a candidate for being used elsewhere in the world for time zone purposes?
Does the 60 minute single charge rule apply from full hour to hour or is it exactly 60 minutes? Secondly if first the toll calculates 13 SEK, then comes 8 SEK which is within 60 minutes of the first and is ignored what should happen if within 60 minutes of the second comes a third toll of say 6 SEK
Are cities perhaps planned to be grouped into districts/states?

Next steps
Write up missing tests
I would implement the missing holidays as a separate holiday table, and simply double check both the weekend days and the holidays through a new validator.
Exempt vehicle check would be done much the same, the REST api would get a new field for the exempt vehicles and I would simply query the table for it.
Move daily limit from constant in code to city level
Move the single charge rule 60 minutes to city level
